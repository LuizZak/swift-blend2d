/// Geometry type.
/// 
/// Geometry describes a shape or path that can be either rendered or added to a BLPath container. Both `BLPath`
/// and `BLContext` provide functionality to work with all geometry types. Please note that each type provided
/// here requires to pass a matching struct or class to the function that consumes a `geometry_type` and `geometry_data`
/// arguments.
/// 
/// \cond INTERNAL
/// - note: Always modify `BLGeometryType.simpleLast` and related functions when adding a new type to `BLGeometryType`
/// enum. Some functions just pass the geometry type and data to another function, but the rendering context must copy
/// simple types to a render job, which means that it must know which type is simple and also sizes of all simple
/// types.
