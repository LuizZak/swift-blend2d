This is a brief status report of what is and isn't ported yet. Contributions to help create Swift wrapper structures are welcome.

Some of the C structures (like `BLLine`, `BLBox`, `BLMatrix2D` etc.) are already visible in Swift but lack many operators that are implemented only in C++. It'd be nice to port such operators to Swift using public extensions.

This may change at any moment.
